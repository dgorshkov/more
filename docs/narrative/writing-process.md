# Writing Process

## Guiding Principle
The story is fixed.  
The delivery is modular.

Narrative does not “evolve during production” — it is decomposed.

---

## Step 1: Canonical Narrative
Write a complete, linear prose outline (10–20 pages):
- Beginning to end
- No branching
- No gameplay considerations
- No dialogue focus

This document defines what *actually happened*.

---

## Step 2: Non-Negotiables
Extract immutable rules from the story:
- The Beast is never controlled
- The protagonist is not a hero
- The mothership is destroyed by allied fire
- The final perspective belongs to the AI

If a mechanic contradicts these, the mechanic is cut.

---

## Step 3: Narrative Atoms
Break the story into atomic units:
- One realization
- One decision
- One irreversible change

Each atom fits on a single card.

No dialogue yet.

---

## Step 4: Assign Delivery Modes
Each atom is delivered **once**, via:
- Gameplay event
- Environmental change
- Audio log
- Comms exchange
- System message
- Silence / absence

Never repeat an atom in multiple forms.

---

## Step 5: Dialogue Writing
Write dialogue as:
- Short comms bursts
- Interrupted exchanges
- 3–5 lines maximum

No speeches. No exposition.

If it feels thin on the page, it’s correct.

---

## Step 6: Logs & Journals
Logs are:
- Personal
- Incomplete
- Not written for the player

They convey emotional truth, not plot clarity.

---

## Step 7: Silence Pass
Final pass removes unnecessary lines:
- Deaths may occur without comment
- Decisions may not be acknowledged
- Absence is intentional

Silence is a narrative tool.

---

## Quality Check
If the story still works when:
- logs are missed
- dialogue is skipped
- the player focuses only on mechanics

Then the writing is successful.
