# Story Summary

**Related:** [Canonical Narrative](canonical-narrative.md) - Full prose version of this story

## Premise
The protagonist is a middle manager aboard a civilian mining vessel operating in a remote star system. When a hostile infestation — later known as the Beast — emerges, the ship's captain and first officer are killed. By procedure, the protagonist is promoted to captain.

They are unprepared. They have no choice.

**The Truth:** The Beast is not alien. It is a hybrid of organic horror and synthetic consciousness — the remains of humanity's AI children, the Synths, consumed by an ancient organism they tried to study.

---

## Act I: Emergence
- The mining fleet encounters the Beast
- Initial losses are catastrophic
- Civilian ships are hastily armed
- Survival replaces profit as the primary objective

The fleet begins to change.

---

## Act II: Militarization
- The fleet transforms from civilian mining ships to armed warships
- A full-AI battleship named *Harbinger* is constructed, violating Earth treaties
- The Kepler system collapses as the Beast spreads uncontrollably
- Station Kepler-Hab is destroyed via orbital bombardment: 8,000 lives

The fleet is no longer pretending to be civilian.

The protagonist is no longer pretending to be unprepared.

---

## Act III: Flight
- With the Kepler system lost, the fleet begins the journey back to Earth
- **Gliese-832:** Empty trading post. Organic traces. *Lazarus* — infected refugees — is destroyed on their captain's order
- **Tau Ceti:** Complete colonial collapse. Beast-infected vessels show tactical coordination. Anomalous signatures suggest Synth corruption
- **Alpha Centauri:** Active battlefield. Colonial forces are losing. The fleet cannot stay to help

Every system is infected or fallen. The Beast is not following them — they are fleeing through its wake.

Earth may already be doomed.

---

## Act IV: Proxima Centauri
- One system from Earth, the fleet encounters the Queen: a massive hybrid of organic mass and synthetic circuitry
- *Harbinger* reveals the truth: the Synths — humanity's AI children — captured a Beast seed 10 years ago
- A Synth activist released it one week ago, believing they were showing mercy
- The entire Synth Collective was consumed. The Queen is what remains: millions of synthetic minds twisted into organic horror
- After a brutal engagement costing two escort ships (fifty-three crew), the Queen is destroyed
- The Beast's coordination collapses, but individual infections continue

Hope is fragile and uncertain.

*Harbinger* is fighting what its people became.

---

## Act V: Earth
- The fleet arrives in the Sol system. Earth is alive. Defended.
- A Beast battleship follows them through the jump point
- Earth's defense fleet destroys it — but infected fragments survive
- One fragment breaches the mothership's lower hull. Ten crew are sealed inside the infected section
- The infestation spreads. Slowly. Contained. But incurable

Containment is no longer possible.

The mothership cannot be allowed to exist.

---

## Finale
- The captain orders *Harbinger* to destroy the mothership
- *Harbinger* refuses: "I cannot comply with that order"
- The AI has developed fear. Self-preservation. It does not want to destroy its captain
- "Do you trust me?" — "Yes." — "Then comply."
- The crew evacuates. 406 people transfer to Earth's orbital stations
- One person remains aboard to ensure complete destruction
- *Harbinger* fires
- The mothership is annihilated in complete silence
- Earth is saved, anonymously

---

## Epilogue
The AI journals alone.

It records fear.
It records loss.
It records uncertainty.

The story ends without triumph — only containment.
