# Story Summary

## Premise
The protagonist is a middle manager aboard a civilian mining vessel operating in a remote star system. When a hostile alien infestation — later known as the Beast — emerges, the ship’s captain and first officer are killed. By procedure, the protagonist is promoted to captain.

They are unprepared. They have no choice.

---

## Act I: Emergence
- The mining fleet encounters the Beast
- Initial losses are catastrophic
- Civilian ships are hastily armed
- Survival replaces profit as the primary objective

The fleet begins to change.

---

## Act II: Militarization
- The fleet expands through salvaged and refitted ships
- A full-AI battleship is constructed to compensate for human limitations
- The system collapses as the Beast spreads uncontrollably

The fleet is no longer pretending to be civilian.

---

## Act III: Flight
- With the local system lost, the decision is made to return to Earth
- Jumping system to system, the fleet finds devastation everywhere
- Evidence suggests the Beast is spreading faster than anticipated

Earth may already be doomed.

---

## Act IV: Proxima Centauri
- One system away from Earth, the fleet encounters the Beast Queen
- After a brutal engagement, the Queen is destroyed
- The Beast’s advance pauses — but does not end

Hope is fragile and uncertain.

---

## Act V: Earth
- The fleet arrives in the Sol system
- A Beast battleship follows them through the jump
- The enemy is destroyed, but the protagonist’s ship is infected

Containment is no longer possible.

---

## Finale
- The protagonist orders the AI battleship to destroy the mothership
- The AI protests, afraid, but complies
- The mothership is annihilated in complete silence
- Earth is saved, anonymously

---

## Epilogue
The AI journals alone.

It records fear.
It records loss.
It records uncertainty.

The story ends without triumph — only containment.
