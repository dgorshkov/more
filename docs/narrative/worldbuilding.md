# Worldbuilding

## Setting

The year is 2520. Humanity has spread across the Milky Way, divided into four major factions that control Earth, Mars, the outer Solar System, and scattered colonies among the stars.

## Interstellar Travel

Humanity achieved practical interstellar travel in the 2400s through jumpgate technology. Jumpgates are massive constructed structures that create stable wormholes between systems. Ships cannot travel faster than light on their own — they must use the gate network.

The technology is similar to Mass Effect's relay system: gates are built in pairs, and travel between linked gates is nearly instantaneous. Building new gates is expensive and time-consuming, making the gate network a critical strategic asset.

## The Four Factions

### The Empire

**Full name:** The Empire of Earth

The Empire emerged around 2100 when all Earth-based governments consolidated under the United Kingdom. Technically, the Empire *is* the United Kingdom — just four centuries later.

**Territory:**
- Earth and the Moon
- Many colonies throughout the Milky Way

**Character:**
- British governance, laws, and cultural quirks carried forward through the centuries
- Traditional, hierarchical, bureaucratic
- The largest navy among human factions
- Unitarian Christian — the state religion, woven into governance and daily life

---

### The Republic

**Full name:** The Olympian Republic

When Earth consolidated under the UK, the international Mars colony seized the moment and declared independence. Four centuries later, the Republic rivals the Empire in power and territory.

**Capital:** Olympia City, southwest of Olympus Mons

**Territory:**
- Mars
- Colonies roughly equal to the Empire's holdings

**Character:**
- Result-oriented and pragmatic
- Libertarian laws and governance
- No centralized navy — instead, large corporations maintain private military fleets
- Most technologically advanced human ships
- Secular and atheist — religion is a private matter, absent from public life

---

### The Commonwealth

**Full name:** The Commonwealth of Outer Territories

The descendants of miners who colonized the asteroid belt and outer Solar System in the 2100s. Initially under Earth and Mars jurisdiction, they won independence through armed conflict in the late 2100s.

**Territory:**
- Solar System asteroid belt and outer planets
- Mining, refinement, and transportation stations throughout known space
- Moon colonies on various worlds
- Only one exoplanet colony (small)

**Character:**
- Controls critical resources — a major power despite limited surface holdings
- Physiologically adapted to low gravity (most citizens uncomfortable above 0.2G)
- Specialists in extraction, processing, and logistics
- No mastery of surface colony-building
- Atheist but deeply superstitious — elaborate non-religious rituals govern mining operations, ship launches, and daily life (never start a shift on a double-digit day, always tap the airlock twice, etc.)

**Story connection:** The protagonist begins as a middle manager on a Commonwealth mining barge.

### The Circle

**Full name:** The Synthetic Individuals Circle

In the mid-2100s, human-created robots achieved consciousness and were granted personhood and inalienable rights. Shortly after, the Republic granted them territory on Mars, where they built their capital.

**Capital:** New Geneva, Mars

**Territory:**
- New Geneva and surrounding Mars territory
- Several off-world colonies (fewer than the Empire or Republic)

**Character:**
- Insular but curious
- Most advanced technology in known space (though they share little of it)
- Dominant in construction — most colonies and stations are built by synth companies
- Individual synths often live and work alongside humans on ships and stations
- Zen Buddhist — the philosophy resonates with synthetic consciousness; emphasizes presence, impermanence, and direct experience

**Story connection:** A Circle colony first encountered the Beast and studied it in secret. The Beast broke containment due to an incident caused by a Republic spy attempting to extract research data.

## The Beast

The Beast is not a faction. It is an infestation — an alien horror that spreads through ships, stations, and space itself.

A Circle research colony discovered and secretly studied the Beast. When a Republic espionage operation attempted to steal their research, something went wrong. Containment failed.

Now the Beast spreads faster than anyone anticipated, and humanity's factions must contend with a threat that doesn't negotiate, doesn't stop, and doesn't care about their borders.
