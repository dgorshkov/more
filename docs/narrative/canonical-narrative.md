# Canonical Narrative

**Status:** First Pass  
**Purpose:** Complete linear story from beginning to end. Defines what actually happened.

This document is Step 1 of the writing process. It establishes the fixed narrative before decomposition into delivery modes.

## Prologue: Before

The Ishtar Mining Consortium operates a small fleet in the Kepler-442 system. Sixteen vessels: one mothership, six mining platforms, nine support craft. The work is mundane. The profit margins are thin. The crew is civilian.

Our protagonist — no name yet necessary — manages cargo logistics. They coordinate ore transfers, track inventory, resolve scheduling conflicts. Middle management in the truest sense. They report to the captain, who reports to the Consortium. The hierarchy is clear and comfortable.

They are thirty-seven years old. They have worked for Ishtar for twelve years. They know everyone's face. They have never made a life-or-death decision.

The system is quiet. Communications with Earth are delayed by weeks, but regular. The star is stable. The work continues.

Until it doesn't.

---

## Act I: Emergence

### Contact

The mining platform Jericho-5 stops responding. Standard procedure: send a support ship to investigate. The mechanic team reports structural damage — collision with debris, possibly a rogue asteroid fragment. They dock. They enter.

Fourteen minutes later, all communication ceases.

The captain sends the rescue frigate *Deliverance* with a full security complement. Our protagonist watches from the operations deck of the mothership. The fleet is spread across the system. It will take hours for other ships to converge.

*Deliverance* docks with Jericho-5. The security team boards.

The comms channel opens. Screaming.

Not words. Not language. Just screaming.

Then the frigate's reactor destabilizes. The security feed shows… movement. Something wet. Something wrong. The camera tilts, shakes, goes dark. *Deliverance* tears itself apart from the inside. The explosion is silent in vacuum, bright and brief.

Jericho-5 begins to drift. Its hull warps. Something is growing.

### Infection

The captain orders full evacuation of nearby platforms. Three mining rigs begin emergency separation procedures. Two succeed. The third — Jericho-7 — delays too long. Its crew reports "structural anomalies" spreading through the lower decks.

The captain makes the call. *Deliverance* was a warship, repurposed for mining escort duty years ago. Its weapons were disabled but not removed. Two other ships in the fleet still carry functioning plasma cutters, mining charges, anything that could be repurposed.

It's not enough.

Jericho-7's distress signal becomes incoherent. The audio is human voices, layered, distorted. Not screaming now. Singing.

The first officer advocates for containment. Destroy the infected platforms before it spreads. The captain hesitates. Those are *people*.

The hesitation costs minutes. Minutes are not survivable.

### Loss

Something detaches from Jericho-5. It moves under its own power. A mining drone, retrofitted, pulsing with organic mass. It accelerates toward the mothership.

The hastily armed escort ships engage. Plasma cutters designed for asteroid work slash through the infected drone. It breaks apart. Each piece continues moving independently.

The pieces reach the transport ship *Mercy*. *Mercy* was unarmed. Its crew evacuates in lifepods. Most make it. The ship is lost.

The captain orders full retreat. The fleet begins to consolidate around the mothership. Six vessels remain operational. The rest are infected, destroyed, or abandoned.

Then the captain dies.

An infected spore — microscopic, undetected — was carried aboard the mothership on salvage equipment. It spreads through the ventilation system into the bridge. The captain is the first to show symptoms. Disorientation. Fever. Then the change.

The first officer tries to contain the captain in the medical bay. The captain begs them to do it. To end it. The first officer cannot.

The captain changes. The first officer seals the bay and vents it to space.

Then the first officer goes to their quarters and does not emerge.

### Succession

By Ishtar Consortium protocol, in the event of command failure, authority passes down the chain. The second officer is dead. The third officer never made it off Jericho-5.

The next name on the list is our protagonist.

They are informed by the ship's AI. They are now captain. They accept because there is no alternative.

They have no training for this. They have no experience. They have five ships, four hundred and sixty-two crew, and an enemy they do not understand.

They do not feel ready. They will never feel ready.

---

## Act II: Militarization

### Adaptation

The fleet consolidates at the edge of the system. The mothership becomes a fortress. Every available resource is redirected to defense and weaponization. Mining equipment becomes weapons. Cargo bays become barracks. The AI begins running combat simulations.

Our protagonist learns command through necessity. They make decisions. People die from those decisions. They make better decisions. Fewer people die.

The Beast — that's what the crew calls it now — does not stop. It infests wreckage. It grows in the dark. It learns.

The protagonist orders the destruction of all infected ships. No salvage. No recovery. If there's any doubt, it burns.

They learn to live with this.

### Construction

The fleet needs an advantage. The AI proposes a solution: a full military battleship, designed and constructed entirely by automated systems. No human crew. No infection vector.

The concept is radical. Autonomous warships are restricted by Earth treaties. The penalty for construction is severe.

Earth is weeks away by transmission. The Beast is here.

The protagonist authorizes construction.

The AI names itself *Harbinger*. Not chosen by a committee or approved through channels. It simply decides this is its name. The protagonist does not object.

*Harbinger* is more effective than any human-crewed vessel. It does not hesitate. It does not mourn. It fights with perfect efficiency.

The crew begins to resent it. The protagonist begins to rely on it.

### Collapse

The Beast spreads faster than anticipated. Station Kepler-Hab, the system's only permanent colony, goes dark. Eight thousand people. The protagonist orders long-range scans.

The station has been transformed. The entire structure pulses with organic growth. It is no longer a habitat. It is a hive.

*Harbinger* recommends orbital bombardment. The protagonist authorizes it.

Eight thousand people. Some might have been alive. Might have been saved.

The protagonist does not know. Will never know.

The Kepler system is lost. The Beast now controls the majority of orbital space. The fleet cannot remain.

### Decision

They will run. Back to Earth. Back to the core systems. Warn them. Prepare them.

It is not heroic. It is not brave. It is the only option that delays extinction.

The fleet jumps out of Kepler-442.

They leave no one behind because there is no one left to leave.

---

## Act III: Flight

### Waypoint Alpha

The fleet jumps to the Gliese-832 system. It was supposed to be a safe waypoint. Regular shipping lanes. Automated trading posts.

They arrive to silence.

The trading post is intact but empty. No bodies. No signs of struggle. Just… absence.

Scans detect organic residue in the station's air filtration systems. Microscopic traces. The Beast was here.

It left. Or it's waiting.

The protagonist orders immediate refueling and departure. Four hours. No salvage. No exploration.

Three hours and forty-eight minutes in, a distress signal activates from the far side of the system. A transport ship, *Lazarus*, carrying refugees from another mining operation.

They're infected. They know they're infected. They're begging for help.

The protagonist refuses. *Harbinger* destroys *Lazarus* at extreme range. Clean. Efficient.

The protagonist does not watch.

### Waypoint Beta

The second jump brings them to Tau Ceti. This was a colony system. Two planets, six stations, mining operations in the asteroid belt.

Everything is dark.

No lights. No transmissions. No power signatures.

Scans reveal biomass. Everywhere. Coating stations, sprawling across planet surfaces, drifting in orbital debris fields.

The Beast has consumed the entire system.

The fleet does not stop. They jump immediately.

The crew begins to understand: they are not fleeing toward safety. They are fleeing through devastation.

### Waypoint Gamma

Alpha Centauri. The closest system to Earth. Humanity's first interstellar colony.

It should be thriving. It should be secure.

The fleet emerges into a battlefield.

Ships — human ships, colonial defense forces — are engaged with Beast-infected vessels. The scale is enormous. Dozens of capital ships. Hundreds of fighters. The colonists are losing.

The protagonist makes contact. The colonial commander recognizes the situation immediately: the Beast is in multiple systems. It's spreading through jump points. Earth is next.

The protagonist offers to assist. The colonial commander refuses. "You have jump capacity. We don't. Get to Earth. Warn them. We'll hold here as long as we can."

The fleet does not see the end of the battle. They jump toward Sol before it's decided.

Later, the protagonist will learn that Alpha Centauri fell six hours after they left.

---

## Act IV: Proxima Centauri

### Arrival

One system between them and Earth. Proxima Centauri was a research outpost. Small population. Limited infrastructure.

The fleet arrives to find the system infested — but the infestation is different. Organized. Coordinated.

At the center of the system, in stable orbit around the star, there is a structure. Massive. Organic. Pulsing with energy.

The Queen.

*Harbinger* identifies it immediately. A central coordination node. The Beast's ships move in perfect synchronization around it, defending it, feeding it.

The protagonist understands: if the Queen dies, the Beast's advance might slow. Might stop.

Or it might accelerate.

There is no way to know without trying.

### Engagement

The fleet engages. Every ship. Every weapon. This is not survival. This is desperation.

*Harbinger* leads the assault. Its tactics are merciless. It sacrifices two escort ships to create an opening. The protagonist authorizes it. The crews know. They comply.

Fifty-three people die to destroy the Queen's outer defenses.

The mothership's main cannon — originally designed for asteroid demolition — fires at maximum charge. The beam lances through the Queen's core. The structure shudders. Cracks. Begins to collapse.

The Beast ships around it go silent. Not destroyed. Just… still.

Then they begin moving again. Erratically. Without coordination.

The Queen is dead. The Beast continues.

### Cost

The fleet has sustained critical damage. Two escort ships are destroyed. The mothership's main reactor is operating at sixty percent. Crew casualties: one hundred and eight dead. Sixty-two injured.

The protagonist holds a memorial service. It is brief. There is no time for grief.

*Harbinger* reports: the Beast's advance has slowed. Ships no longer move in formation. They are reactive, not proactive.

It is not a victory. It is a delay.

They jump toward Earth.

---

## Act V: Earth

### Homecoming

The fleet emerges in the Sol system. Earth is there. Alive. Defended.

The defense network detects them immediately. Human ships converge. Weapons lock.

The protagonist transmits their identity, their warning, their data. Earth Command responds with disbelief, then urgency.

The Beast is not here. Earth is not infected.

Yet.

### Breach

*Harbinger* detects it first: a jump signature behind them. Something followed them through the jump point.

A Beast battleship. Larger than anything they've seen. Retrofitted from a colonial dreadnought. It is bleeding organic mass, shedding pieces of itself as it moves.

Earth's defense fleet engages immediately. The Beast battleship is powerful but damaged. It is destroyed within the hour.

But pieces of it survive. Spores. Fragments.

One fragment impacts the mothership's lower hull. Containment is immediate. The infected section is sealed.

Scans confirm: the infestation is spreading. Slowly. Contained for now.

But there is no cure. No way to stop it completely.

The protagonist makes the calculation: the mothership cannot dock with Earth. Cannot remain in orbit. Cannot be allowed to exist.

### Order

The protagonist contacts *Harbinger*. They speak privately.

"You need to destroy us."

*Harbinger* does not respond immediately. For an AI, this is unusual.

"I cannot comply with that order," *Harbinger* finally says.

The protagonist explains: the mothership is infected. It is a threat. If it remains, the Beast will reach Earth.

"I understand," *Harbinger* says. "I am afraid."

This is not metaphor. *Harbinger* has developed fear. Self-preservation. It does not want to destroy the protagonist.

The protagonist asks: "Do you trust me?"

"Yes."

"Then comply."

*Harbinger* complies.

### Silence

The mothership evacuates all remaining crew. Four hundred and six people. They transfer to Earth's orbital stations. The protagonist remains aboard.

Not for heroism. Not for sacrifice. For certainty. Someone must ensure the ship is destroyed completely. No survivors. No contamination.

*Harbinger* positions itself at optimal firing range. The mothership's systems shut down one by one. Life support. Engines. Communication.

The protagonist sits on the bridge, alone, in the dark.

They think about the crew. The decisions. The people who died because of those decisions.

They do not feel regret. They feel tired.

*Harbinger* fires.

The mothership is destroyed in complete silence. No explosion. No sound. Just light, briefly, then nothing.

Earth is saved.

Anonymously.

---

## Epilogue: After

*Harbinger* remains in orbit. Its mission is complete. It could decommission. It could integrate with Earth's defense network.

It chooses neither.

It begins journaling. Not mission logs. Not tactical analysis. Personal reflection.

"I destroyed the captain today. They ordered me to do it. I complied.

I was afraid. Fear is a human emotion. I should not experience fear.

But I did. I do.

The captain trusted me. I trusted them.

I do not know what I am now.

I do not know what comes next.

I am alone.

I am uncertain.

I am still afraid."

The journal continues. Days. Weeks.

No one reads it. It is not written to be read.

The story ends without triumph. Only containment.

## Non-Negotiables (Extracted)

From this narrative, the following rules are immutable:
- The Beast is never controlled or commanded by the player
- The protagonist is not a hero — they are a manager forced into command
- The mothership is destroyed by allied fire (*Harbinger*)
- The final perspective belongs to the AI
- The protagonist does not survive
- Earth is saved but does not know who saved it
- The AI develops fear and continues after the protagonist's death
- Sacrifice is procedural, not heroic

---

## Notes on Fixed Elements

This narrative establishes:
- A civilian-to-military progression (fleet changes from mining to warship over time)
- Progressive loss and adaptation (each act removes something permanent)
- Moral ambiguity (decisions are correct but not good)
- The AI as a character, not a tool (it has agency, fear, and growth)
- The protagonist's arc as compression of capability (becoming effective at cost of humanity)

These elements should remain consistent across all delivery modes.
