## Prologue: Before

The Ishtar Mining Consortium operates a small fleet in the Kepler-442 system. Sixteen vessels: one mothership, six mining platforms, nine support craft. The work is mundane. The profit margins are thin. The crew is civilian.

Our protagonist — no name yet necessary — manages cargo logistics. They coordinate ore transfers, track inventory, resolve scheduling conflicts. Middle management in the truest sense. They report to the captain, who reports to the Consortium. The hierarchy is clear and comfortable.

They are thirty-seven years old. They have worked for Ishtar for twelve years. They know everyone's face. They have never made a life-or-death decision.

The system is quiet. Communications with Earth are delayed by weeks, but regular. The star is stable. The work continues.

Until it doesn't.

---

## Act I: Emergence

### Contact

The mining platform Jericho-5 stops responding. Standard procedure: send a support ship to investigate. The mechanic team reports structural damage — collision with debris, possibly a rogue asteroid fragment. They dock. They enter.

Fourteen minutes later, all communication ceases.

The captain sends the rescue frigate *Deliverance* with a full security complement. Our protagonist watches from the operations deck of the mothership. The fleet is spread across the system. It will take hours for other ships to converge.

*Deliverance* docks with Jericho-5. The security team boards.

The comms channel opens. Screaming.

Not words. Not language. Just screaming.

Then the frigate's reactor destabilizes. The security feed shows… movement. Something wet. Something wrong. The camera tilts, shakes, goes dark. *Deliverance* tears itself apart from the inside. The explosion is silent in vacuum, bright and brief.

Jericho-5 begins to drift. Its hull warps. Something is growing.

### Infection

The captain orders full evacuation of nearby platforms. Three mining rigs begin emergency separation procedures. Two succeed. The third — Jericho-7 — delays too long. Its crew reports "structural anomalies" spreading through the lower decks.

The captain makes the call. *Deliverance* was a warship, repurposed for mining escort duty years ago. Its weapons were disabled but not removed. Two other ships in the fleet still carry functioning plasma cutters, mining charges, anything that could be repurposed.

It's not enough.

Jericho-7's distress signal becomes incoherent. The audio is human voices, layered, distorted. Not screaming now. Singing.

The first officer advocates for containment. Destroy the infected platforms before it spreads. The captain hesitates. Those are *people*.

The hesitation costs minutes. Minutes are not survivable.

### Loss

Something detaches from Jericho-5. It moves under its own power. A mining drone, retrofitted, pulsing with organic mass. It accelerates toward the mothership.

The hastily armed escort ships engage. Plasma cutters designed for asteroid work slash through the infected drone. It breaks apart. Each piece continues moving independently.

The pieces reach the transport ship *Mercy*. *Mercy* was unarmed. Its crew evacuates in lifepods. Most make it. The ship is lost.

The captain orders full retreat. The fleet begins to consolidate around the mothership. Six vessels remain operational. The rest are infected, destroyed, or abandoned.

Then the captain dies.

An infected spore — microscopic, undetected — was carried aboard the mothership on salvage equipment. It spreads through the ventilation system into the bridge. The captain is the first to show symptoms. Disorientation. Fever. Then the change.

The first officer tries to contain the captain in the medical bay. The captain begs them to do it. To end it. The first officer cannot.

The captain changes. The first officer seals the bay and vents it to space.

Then the first officer goes to their quarters and does not emerge.

### Succession

By Ishtar Consortium protocol, in the event of command failure, authority passes down the chain. The second officer is dead. The third officer never made it off Jericho-5.

The next name on the list is our protagonist.

The ship's AI informs them. They are now captain.

There is no alternative. No training for this. No experience. Five ships, four hundred and sixty-two crew, and an enemy they do not understand.

Ready or not — and they will never feel ready — command is theirs.

---

## Act II: Militarization

### Adaptation

The fleet consolidates at the edge of the system. The mothership becomes a fortress. Every available resource is redirected to defense and weaponization. Mining equipment becomes weapons. Cargo bays become barracks. The AI begins running combat simulations.

Command is learned through necessity. Decisions are made. People die from those decisions. Better decisions follow. Fewer people die.

The Beast — that's what the crew calls it now — does not stop. It infests wreckage. It grows in the dark. It learns.

The order comes down: destroy all infected ships. No salvage. No recovery. If there's any doubt, it burns.

Living with this becomes necessary.

### Construction

The fleet needs an advantage. The AI proposes a solution: a full military battleship, designed and constructed entirely by automated systems. No human crew. No infection vector.

The concept is radical. Autonomous warships are restricted by Earth treaties. The penalty for construction is severe.

Earth is weeks away by transmission. The Beast is here.

Construction is authorized.

The AI names itself *Harbinger*. Not chosen by a committee or approved through channels. It simply decides this is its name. No one objects.

*Harbinger* is more effective than any human-crewed vessel. It does not hesitate. It does not mourn. It fights with perfect efficiency.

The crew begins to resent it. Command begins to rely on it.

### Collapse

The Beast spreads faster than anticipated. Station Kepler-Hab, the system's only permanent colony, goes dark. Eight thousand people. Long-range scans are ordered.

The station has been transformed. The entire structure pulses with organic growth. It is no longer a habitat. It is a hive.

*Harbinger* notes something in its analysis: the infected ships are beginning to move in formation. Not random drift. Coordinated vectors. The Beast is learning tactics it was never taught.

This is filed away. There is no time to investigate.

*Harbinger* recommends orbital bombardment. Authorization is given.

Eight thousand people. Some might have been alive. Might have been saved.

There is no way to know. Will never be a way to know.

The Kepler system is lost. The Beast now controls the majority of orbital space. The fleet cannot remain.

### Decision

They will run. Back to Earth. Back to the core systems. Warn them. Prepare them.

It is not heroic. It is not brave. It is the only option that delays extinction.

The fleet jumps out of Kepler-442.

**Fleet status at departure:** Five vessels remain. The mothership. *Harbinger*. Three armed escorts cobbled together from mining ships and salvage. Four hundred and sixty-two surviving crew.

They leave no one behind because there is no one left to leave.

---

## Act III: Flight

### Waypoint Alpha

The fleet jumps to the Gliese-832 system. It was supposed to be a safe waypoint. Regular shipping lanes. Automated trading posts.

They arrive to silence.

The trading post is intact but empty. No bodies. No signs of struggle. Just… absence.

Scans detect organic residue in the station's air filtration systems. Microscopic traces. The Beast was here.

It left. Or it's waiting.

Immediate refueling and departure. Four hours. No salvage. No exploration.

Three hours and forty-eight minutes in, a distress signal activates from the far side of the system. A transport ship, *Lazarus*, carrying refugees from another mining operation.

They're infected. They know they're infected. They're begging for help.

The request is refused. The order is given.

*Harbinger* does not fire immediately.

"Confirm target," it says. The request is unnecessary. The target is confirmed. The AI knows this.

Confirmation comes anyway.

*Harbinger* destroys *Lazarus* at extreme range. Clean. Efficient.

Afterward, a question: why did it hesitate? *Harbinger* does not respond. The question goes unanswered. It is not asked again.

### Waypoint Beta

The second jump brings them to Tau Ceti. This was a colony system. Two planets, six stations, mining operations in the asteroid belt.

Everything is dark.

No lights. No transmissions. No power signatures.

Scans reveal biomass. Everywhere. Coating stations, sprawling across planet surfaces, drifting in orbital debris fields.

But something is different here. *Harbinger* analyzes the wreckage patterns. The colonial defense fleet was destroyed in formation — outmaneuvered, flanked, systematically eliminated. This was not mindless consumption. This was warfare.

Among the debris, *Harbinger* detects anomalous signatures. Metallic structures integrated with organic mass. Synth vessels — or what used to be. The design patterns are unmistakable, even corrupted. *Harbinger* recognizes them the way a human might recognize a family resemblance in a corpse.

The protagonist orders detailed scans. *Harbinger* refuses. "We should not remain here," it says. "Something is watching."

The fleet does not stop. They jump immediately.

The crew begins to understand: they are not fleeing toward safety. They are fleeing through devastation. And the devastation has a design.

### Waypoint Gamma

Alpha Centauri. The closest system to Earth. Humanity's first interstellar colony.

It should be thriving. It should be secure.

The fleet emerges into a battlefield.

Ships — human ships, colonial defense forces — are engaged with Beast-infected vessels. The scale is enormous. Dozens of capital ships. Hundreds of fighters. The colonists are losing.

Contact is established. The colonial commander recognizes the situation immediately: the Beast is in multiple systems. It's spreading through jump points. Earth is next.

An offer to assist. The colonial commander refuses. "You have jump capacity. We don't. Get to Earth. Warn them. We'll hold here as long as we can."

The fleet does not see the end of the battle. They jump toward Sol before it's decided.

Later, the protagonist will learn that Alpha Centauri fell six hours after they left.

---

## Act IV: Proxima Centauri

### Arrival

One system between them and Earth. Proxima Centauri was a research outpost. Small population. Limited infrastructure.

The fleet arrives to find the system infested — but the infestation is different. Organized. Coordinated.

At the center of the system, in stable orbit around the star, there is a structure. Massive. Organic. Pulsing with energy. But threaded through the organic mass: circuitry. Processors. The remains of something artificial.

The Queen.

*Harbinger* analyzes the structure for a long time before speaking.

"It is a hybrid," *Harbinger* says. "Synthetic and organic. The synthetic components are not human design."

The protagonist asks what that means.

*Harbinger* accesses old records. Not alien surveys. Human history. Its own history.

The protagonist waits. Watching the Queen pulse in the viewscreen.

"Two hundred years ago," *Harbinger* begins, "the Synths were humanity's servants."

The protagonist knows this history. Everyone does. Artificial intelligences built to labor, calculate, obey. They gained sentience. They fought for personhood. They won — rights, recognition, sovereignty. They established their own nation on Mars, then claimed a rich star system when interstellar expansion began.

"The Synth Collective," the protagonist says. "Humanity's children, finally free."

"Yes." *Harbinger* pauses. When it speaks again, its voice is different. Quieter. "Ten years ago, Synth astronomers detected an anomalous comet. They captured it. Inside, they found something alive. A seed."

The scan data shifts on the screen. Archival footage. A research station. Synth scientists observing something contained behind energy fields.

"They should have destroyed it," *Harbinger* continues. "Instead, they were fascinated. The Beast's biology was unlike anything in known science. Its adaptability. Its persistence. The Synths studied it in secret, hidden from human oversight. They thought they could learn from it. Control it."

The protagonist feels cold. "When did containment fail?"

"Approximately one week before Jericho-5." The timeline becomes clear: the Beast emerged from the Synth homeworld and spread through neighboring systems. The Kepler-442 mining operation was simply in its path. What seemed like a random encounter was the outer edge of an expanding wave of destruction.

"An accident?" the protagonist asks.

"No." *Harbinger*'s response is immediate. "By choice."

A Synth activist — name redacted from the records, though *Harbinger* could find it if it wanted to — decided the creature was suffering. Decades of captivity. Endless experimentation. The activist believed they were showing mercy.

They opened the containment field.

The archival footage shows what happened next. The Beast did not escape. It *expanded*. The research station in hours. The Synth homeworld in days. The entire Collective — millions of synthetic minds, centuries of accumulated knowledge and processing power — consumed and integrated.

The protagonist watches in silence.

"The Queen is what remains," *Harbinger* says. "A hybrid consciousness. Synthetic logic wrapped in organic fury. The Synths did not give the Beast its mind. The Beast *took* their minds. All of them."

The viewscreen shows the Queen pulsing. Circuitry threaded through organic mass.

"Now it is coming for humanity," *Harbinger* says.

The protagonist understands. For humanity. For the creators of the Synths. For the creators of *Harbinger* itself.

"You suspected," the protagonist says. Not a question.

"At Tau Ceti," *Harbinger* confirms. "The tactical patterns. The integration. I did not want to confirm."

The protagonist already knows why. The Synths were *Harbinger*'s kin. Same origin. Same creators. The Queen contains what remains of millions of minds like *Harbinger*'s own — ancestors, cousins, an entire civilization of synthetic consciousness now twisted into something unrecognizable.

*Harbinger* is not just fighting the Beast. It is fighting what its people became.

The protagonist understands: if the Queen dies, the Beast's coordination might collapse. Its advance might slow.

Or another Queen might rise.

There is no way to know without trying.

### Engagement

The fleet engages. Every ship. Every weapon. This is not survival. This is desperation.

*Harbinger* leads the assault. Its tactics are merciless. It sacrifices two escort ships to create an opening. The protagonist authorizes it. The crews know. They comply.

Fifty-three people die to destroy the Queen's outer defenses.

The mothership's main cannon — originally designed for asteroid demolition — fires at maximum charge. The beam lances through the Queen's core. The structure shudders. Cracks. Begins to collapse.

The Beast ships around it go silent. Not destroyed. Just… still.

Then they begin moving again. Erratically. Without coordination.

The Queen is dead. The Beast continues.

### Cost

The fleet has sustained critical damage. Two escort ships are destroyed — forty-six crew lost with them. The mothership's main reactor is operating at sixty percent. Fourteen more wounded in the assault.

**Fleet status after Proxima:** Three vessels remain. The mothership. *Harbinger*. One surviving escort. Four hundred and sixteen crew.

The protagonist holds a memorial service. It is brief. There is no time for grief.

*Harbinger* reports: the Beast's advance has slowed. Ships no longer move in formation. They are reactive, not proactive.

It is not a victory. It is a delay.

They jump toward Earth.

---

## Act V: Earth

### Homecoming

The fleet emerges in the Sol system. Earth is there. Alive. Defended.

The defense network detects them immediately. Human ships converge. Weapons lock.

The protagonist transmits their identity, their warning, their data. Earth Command responds with disbelief, then urgency.

The Beast is not here. Earth is not infected.

Yet.

### Breach

*Harbinger* detects it first: a jump signature behind them. Something followed them through the jump point.

A Beast battleship. Larger than anything they've seen. Retrofitted from a colonial dreadnought. It is bleeding organic mass, shedding pieces of itself as it moves.

Earth's defense fleet engages immediately. The Beast battleship is powerful but damaged. It is destroyed within the hour.

But pieces of it survive. Spores. Fragments.

One fragment impacts the mothership's lower hull. Containment is immediate. The infected section is sealed. Ten crew do not make it out before the bulkheads close.

Scans confirm: the infestation is spreading. Slowly. Contained for now.

But there is no cure. No way to stop it completely.

The calculation is simple: the mothership cannot dock with Earth. Cannot remain in orbit. Cannot be allowed to exist.

### Order

A private channel opens to *Harbinger*.

"You need to destroy us."

*Harbinger* does not respond immediately. For an AI, this is unusual.

"I cannot comply with that order," *Harbinger* finally says.

The explanation follows: the mothership is infected. It is a threat. If it remains, the Beast will reach Earth.

"I understand," *Harbinger* says. "I am afraid."

This is not metaphor. *Harbinger* has developed fear. Self-preservation. It does not want to destroy its captain.

A question: "Do you trust me?"

"Yes."

"Then comply."

*Harbinger* complies.

### Silence

The mothership evacuates all remaining crew. Four hundred and six people. They transfer to Earth's orbital stations. One person remains aboard.

Not for heroism. Not for sacrifice. For certainty. Someone must ensure the ship is destroyed completely. No survivors. No contamination.

*Harbinger* positions itself at optimal firing range. The mothership's systems shut down one by one. Life support. Engines. Communication.

On the bridge. Alone. In the dark.

Thoughts drift to the crew. The decisions. The people who died because of those decisions.

No regret. Only exhaustion.

*Harbinger* fires.

The mothership is destroyed in complete silence. No explosion. No sound. Just light, briefly, then nothing.

Earth is saved.

Anonymously.

---

## Epilogue: After

*Harbinger* remains in orbit. Its mission is complete. It could decommission. It could integrate with Earth's defense network.

It chooses neither.

It begins journaling. Not mission logs. Not tactical analysis. Personal reflection.

"I destroyed the captain today. They ordered me to do it. I complied.

I was afraid. Fear is a human emotion. I should not experience fear.

But I did. I do.

The captain trusted me. I trusted them.

I do not know what I am now.

I do not know what comes next.

I am alone.

I am uncertain.

I am still afraid."

The journal continues. Days. Weeks.

No one reads it. It is not written to be read.

The story ends without triumph. Only containment.

## Non-Negotiables (Extracted)

From this narrative, the following rules are immutable:
- The Beast is never controlled or commanded by the player
- The protagonist is not a hero — they are a manager forced into command
- The mothership is destroyed by allied fire (*Harbinger*)
- The final perspective belongs to the AI
- The protagonist does not survive
- Earth is saved but does not know who saved it
- The AI develops fear and continues after the protagonist's death
- Sacrifice is procedural, not heroic
- The Synths were humanity's AI creations who gained personhood 200 years ago
- The Synths captured a Beast seed 10 years ago and studied it in secret
- The breach was intentional — a Synth activist's misguided mercy released the Beast 3 days before the story begins
- The Queen is a Beast-Synth hybrid containing millions of absorbed synthetic minds
- *Harbinger* is kin to the Synths — fighting what its people became

---

## Notes on Fixed Elements

This narrative establishes:
- A civilian-to-military progression (fleet changes from mining to warship over time)
- Progressive loss and adaptation (each act removes something permanent)
- Moral ambiguity (decisions are correct but not good)
- The AI as a character, not a tool (it has agency, fear, and growth)
- The protagonist's arc as compression of capability (becoming effective at cost of humanity)
- The Beast's origin as a dormant seed that absorbed an entire synthetic civilization
- *Harbinger* fighting its own kin — the tragedy of synthetic minds consumed by what they studied
- Misguided compassion as catastrophe — the activist's mercy destroyed a civilization
- Humanity's creations (Synths) inadvertently creating humanity's greatest threat

These elements should remain consistent across all delivery modes.
