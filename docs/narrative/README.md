# Narrative Documentation

This directory contains all story-related content and narrative design documentation.

## Contents

- **story-summary.md** - The complete story arc from beginning to end
- **writing-process.md** - Guidelines and process for narrative writing

## Purpose

The narrative documentation defines the fixed, canonical story and the modular delivery approach. This ensures consistent storytelling across all game systems while allowing flexible implementation.

## Adding New Content

When adding new narrative documents:
- Character bios and development should go here
- Mission briefs and story beats
- Audio log scripts
- Dialogue trees and comms exchanges
- Any story-related reference material
