# Game Concept

## Working Title
(Homeworld: Emergence–inspired, final title TBD)

## Genre
Turn-based tactical strategy  
Narrative-driven survival  
Horror-leaning science fiction

## Core Pillars
- Token-based tactical combat (Darkest Dungeon 2–inspired)
- Strong narrative delivered through systems, not cutscenes
- Scarcity, pressure, and irreversible loss
- Controller-first design

---

## Player Fantasy
Commanding a small, irreplaceable fleet against an unknowable infestation, making hard operational decisions where survival often means sacrifice, not victory.

---

## Fleet Composition
- 1 Mothership (mobile base, logistics, repairs — not deployed in combat)
- Up to 5 combat ships per encounter (selected from your fleet)

### Ship Classes
- **Cruiser** — Large, slow initiative, fewer actions, never permanently lost
- **Destroyer** — Medium, balanced stats
- **Gunship** — Small, fast initiative, more actions per turn

No unit spam. Every loss matters.

---

## Tactical Combat
- Turn-based with action points per ship
- Initiative order: smaller ships act first (Battletech-style)
- Token system (DD2-inspired): ships accumulate positive, negative, and special state tokens
- Fighters/bombers are ship abilities, not separate units
- No grid or formation positioning — combat is about states, not space

Strategic planning and foresight are essential.

---

## The Beast (Primary Antagonist)
- Completely hostile
- No infected units under player control
- Acts as an environmental threat, not a conventional faction
- Infests wrecks, stations, and space itself

Inspired by:
- Dead Space infection
- System Shock 2’s “Many”

---

## Resource & Inventory Management
Resources are physical and limited:
- Materials
- Crew
- Power
- Containment integrity (global pressure)

Repairs, upgrades, and survival compete for the same pool.

---

## Tone & Aesthetic
- Quiet, oppressive, restrained
- Horror through uncertainty and malfunction
- Minimal music, strong use of silence
- UI and sound design emphasize stress and degradation

---

## Key Promise
A strategy game where you don’t win by overpowering the enemy —  
you win by preventing something worse.
