# Source Code

This directory will contain the game's source code.

## Organization

When development begins, organize code by:
- Game systems (combat, fleet management, resources, etc.)
- Engine-specific structure
- Shared utilities and libraries
- Configuration and data files

## Code Standards

Follow the coding standards to be defined in `docs/technical/` as development progresses.
