# Game

This directory contains the actual game implementation.

## Structure

- **src/** - Source code for the game
- **assets/** - Game assets (models, textures, audio, etc.)
- **tests/** - Game code tests and test utilities

## Getting Started

This directory is currently a placeholder for future game development. When development begins:

1. Choose your game engine/framework
2. Set up the build system
3. Add engine-specific structure under `src/`
4. Configure asset pipeline in `assets/`
5. Set up testing framework in `tests/`

## Engine Considerations

Given the game concept (tactical RTS with horror elements), consider:
- Real-time strategy requirements
- Controller-first design needs
- Performance for fleet management
- Audio system capabilities for atmospheric horror
- Mod support potential
