This directory will contain all game assets.

## Structure

Organize assets by type:
- **models/** - 3D models for ships, stations, and objects
- **textures/** - Texture maps and materials
- **audio/** - Sound effects, music, and voice lines
- **ui/** - UI sprites, fonts, and interface elements
- **vfx/** - Visual effects and particle systems
- **data/** - Game data files (ship stats, progression, etc.)

## Asset Pipeline

Document the asset creation and integration pipeline as it's established:
- File formats and naming conventions
- Source files vs. game-ready files
- Optimization requirements
- Version control strategy for binary files
