# Tests

This directory will contain all game code tests.

## Structure

Organize tests to mirror the source code structure:
- Unit tests for individual systems
- Integration tests for system interactions
- End-to-end tests for gameplay scenarios
- Performance benchmarks

## Testing Strategy

As development progresses:
- Define testing standards and coverage goals
- Set up continuous integration
- Document how to run tests locally
- Maintain test data and fixtures
